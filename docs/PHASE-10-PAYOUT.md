# Phase 10 — Payout and settlement

**Current behavior:** TippyMe does not hold a withdrawable wallet and does not start payouts itself.

Connect onboarding, destination charges, and Friday schedules are implemented. Destination charges run only when Bachs reports transfers or payouts as enabled. A stored `acct_` id alone is onboarding, not connected. Tips taken before that stay labeled as held by TippyMe. There is no later transfer job.

The historical "not implemented" checklist below described an earlier Nest/Postgres snapshot. Treat this header as the source of truth.

TippyMe is not a bank. Successful tip totals on the dashboard are TippyMe business records. They are **not** a withdrawable balance.

## Verified Bachs capabilities (official docs)

Sources: [docs.bachs.io](https://docs.bachs.io), [llms.txt](https://docs.bachs.io/llms.txt), and pages linked from `docs/bachs-integration.md`.

| Area | What Bachs documents |
|------|----------------------|
| Creator settlement | Via **Connect**: destination charges (`transfer_data.destination` + `platform_fee`) or platform collect then `POST /v1/transfers` to recipient accounts |
| Bank accounts | Payout **destinations** (bank / MoMo / crypto); resolve bank account before create; NGN bank transfer documented for fiat withdrawals |
| Balances | `GET` balances — `available_balance`, pending/locked buckets; transfers draw on available only |
| Payouts / withdrawals | `Create Payout` / quote / estimate; async status; webhooks `payout.created`, `payout.paid`, `payout.failed` |
| Transfers | `POST /v1/transfers` between platform and connected accounts (`transfers` capability on recipient) |
| Scheduled settlement | **Payout schedules** on `balance_settings`: `manual`, `instant`, `daily`, `weekly` (weekday list incl. friday), `monthly` — per currency, optional `X-Account-Id` for connected accounts |
| Automated payouts | Bachs schedules automate payout of **settled collections** on that Bachs balance to a default destination — not TippyMe inventing a ledger |

Platform prerequisite: active `connect` capability (`GET /v1/accounts/me` → `enabled_capabilities`). Recipient accounts request `transfers` + `payouts`.

## TippyMe MVP gaps (why payout is not implemented)

1. Checkout does **not** set `transfer_data.destination` — tips are not settled into per-creator Connect balances.
2. No Connect account create / hosted onboarding flow for creators.
3. `CreatorProfile.bachsAccountId` exists for future use but is unused in product flows.
4. **UNKNOWN — NEEDS VERIFICATION:** whether the TippyMe Bachs org already has `connect` enabled.

Without those pieces, a TippyMe “Request payout” or “Withdrawable balance” UI would be **fake**.

## What Phase 10 ships

- Documentation of Bachs vs TippyMe (this file + `bachs-integration.md` settlement section).
- Dashboard `settlement` status:
  - `readiness: NOT_CONFIGURED` (or `CONNECTED` if an `acct_` is stored later)
  - `tippyHoldsWithdrawableBalance: false`
  - `tippyInitiatedPayoutAvailable: false`
  - `automatedFridayPayout: FUTURE_CAPABILITY`
- Extensible types only — no payout POST endpoints, no TippyMe ledger.

## Automatic Friday payout — future capability

Product idea: auto-pay creators on Fridays.

Bachs can schedule weekly payouts including `friday` via `weekly_payout_days` on **Bachs** `balance_settings` — but only after Connect settlement and approved destinations exist.

**Automatic scheduled payout — future capability.** Not built into MVP.

## Future implementation checklist (Connect demo shipped)

Shipped for hackathon demo (see also `docs/DEMO-SCRIPT.md`):

1. ~~Enable platform `connect`; create recipient accounts; hosted onboarding~~ — `POST /api/creators/me/connect/onboard` (stub when no Bachs key).
2. ~~Tip checkout with destination charge tied to `bachsAccountId`~~ — `transfer_data` + `platform_fee` when linked.
3. Optionally read Bachs balances / transfer list for dashboard (never invent TippyMe balances).
4. ~~Optionally set Bachs payout schedules (e.g. weekly friday)~~ — `POST /api/creators/me/connect/friday-payout`.
5. TippyMe UX mirrors Connect readiness only — still no TippyMe wallet.

## Testing

No payout request / webhook payout fulfilment tests in this phase (no payout API).

Covered: settlement status builder unit tests (no withdrawable wallet; future Friday flag).
